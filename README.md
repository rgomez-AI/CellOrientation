## Image acquisition settings for data generation

The scratch assay was carried out
with the following fluorophores:
* Channel 0 : Centrosome marker CEp170, Alexa647
* Channel 1 : Golgi marker GM130, Alexa488

For nuclei detection, cells were stained with 
* Channel 2 : DAPI 

3D multiplex images (stack) of cells were acquired with Stellaris Falcon from Leica.
* Objective Immersion="Oil" LensNA="1.3"
* Model="HC PL APO CS2 40x/1.30 OIL"
* NominalMagnification="40"
* Voxel Size: 0.2841x0.2841x0.3462


## Installation

You will need a current version of `snakemake` to run this workflow. To get `snakemake` please follow the install [instructions](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) on their website, but in brief once `conda` and `mamba` are installed you can install `snakemake` with:

```
mamba create -n snakemake -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake
```

Afterwards you can activate the `conda` environment and download the repository. And all additional dependencies will be handled by `snakemake`.

```
conda activate snakemake
git clone https://github.com/rgomez-AI/CellOrientation.git
```

### Enviroment creation

Create required environments by going to the directory `CellOrientation/workflow` 

where `Snakefile` is located and execute the following command:
```
snakemake --cores all --use-conda --conda-create-envs-only Data_Analysis
```

## Input

Acquired images (multichannel, Z stack and series) storaged in .lif format


## Running

To execute change current directory to the directory `workflow` where `Snakefile` is located.

```
snakemake --cores all --use-conda Data_Analysis
```

## Output

As an output there are two files:
* `results/INNERCells.pdf` which contain the analysis for cells
located at the inner region.

* `results/OUTTERCells.pdf` which contain the analysis for cells
located at the edge region.


## Report generation

For report generation snakemake required `pygments` module and it can be installed with:
```
pip install pygments
```
 
Afterward you can create a report file with the name *report.html* as the example bellow:
```
snakemake Data_Analysis --report report.html
```
